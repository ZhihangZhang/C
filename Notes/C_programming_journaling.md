**Undeclared array**

No code

>  In C, at least back in the old days, variable declarations have to come at the top of the block. C++ is different in that regard.


> edit â€” apparently C99 is different from C90 in this respect (C99 being essentially the same as C++ on this issue).

**Using boolean value in C**

```c
// option 1: giving a type a new name
typedef int bool; // using bool instead of int
#define true 1
#define false 0

// option 2: include library (C99)
#include <stdbool.h> // M$ VS 2012 C89
```

- typedef is used to give a new name to represent the old type throughout the program. 
- typedef can be used to ease the burden of declaring structure.

```c
typedef struct my_struct_type my_short_type_t;
// using my_short_type_t to represent the struct type and to declare variables
```
